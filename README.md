# Food_Delivery_Robot
This is a personal academic project. The aim of this project is to develop a food delivery robot on airplanes. 

The motion is controlled by a Arduino Mega and the detection is controlled by a Resberry Pi. The Arduino is communicating with Resberry Pi via serial channel. 

In the arduino folder.cartmove folder contains the arduino code to control the cart move. cartmoveandstop folder is to control the cart move and stop. playwithkeyboard folder is to 
control the movement of the cart by keyboard. These three folers shows the development of the control of the cart movement. main folder contains the main function, the cart move
